### Grading Standards

### Textbook and Resources
There are no required textbooks for this course, but the following recommended books will give
you valuable references for Python programming:
1. Guttag, J. V. (2016). Introduction to computation and programming using Python: With application to understanding data. MIT Press.
2. McKinney, W. (2012). Python for data analysis: Data wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython. O'Reilly Media, Inc.

Additionally, like any programming language, Python has a wide variety of comprehensive
online resources available. A few that are particularly relevant to this course are listed below:
1. [The Python Language Documentation](https://www.python.org/doc/)
2. [Numpy Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html)
3. [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
4. [SciPy Documentation](https://scipy.org/)
5. [Statsmodels Documentation](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html)
6. [Scikit-learn Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

### Learning Outcomes
Master basic Python knowledge and skills, be able to proficiently use some of Python's fundamental functions, and be capable of using Python to solve some problems in data analytics. Participation in this course will build students’ confidence in using Python, preparing them for more advanced study in Machine Learning (ML) and Business Analytics (BA), and advancement in their careers.

## ChatGPT and Other Programming Resources
Let's be crystal clear: You are professional programmers. Professional programmers use the
internet (ChatGPT, Stackoverflow, Blogs, Github, etc) to find solutions to programming problems roughly
every 5 minutes. I'm not asking you to ignore the perfectly valid and highly beneficial resources
at your disposal when programming for this course; I want you to develop programming skills
that include real-world research techniques. However, I am asking three things:

1. **DO NOT** copy and paste code directly from Stackoverflow, or any other internet resource.
This counts as cheating, see above section of the syllabus. Instead, use solutions found on the
internet as reference implementations to study and help craft your own solution.
2. **DO** attempt to solve all problems by yourself before looking up external resources - this
exercise will engage your analytical mind, and force you to understand the problem better.
Ultimately, the value you get from this course is up to you, but I'd like to see every student learn
every topic to the best of their ability.
3. **DO** completely understand any code you write. This means that if you are stuck and go to the
internet for help, you do not just transcribe code, you study and understand an external solution
to the extent that you can implement the same algorithm on your own. Trust me, this approach
make a huge difference in improving you as a software engineer. Also, if you ever have a
question on a grade for a project, I will ask you to explain your code to me. If you can't, I can't
trust that you actually solved the problem.

Again, it’s up to you to get all the value you can from this course. This material is extremely
valuable to software engineers in the field, and will serve you well if you give it all you've got.

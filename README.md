## ChatGPT and Other Programming Resources
Let's be crystal clear: You are professional programmers. Professional programmers use the
internet (ChatGPT, Stackoverflow, Blogs, Github, etc) to find solutions to programming problems roughly
every 5 minutes. I'm not asking you to ignore the perfectly valid and highly beneficial resources
at your disposal when programming for this course; I want you to develop programming skills
that include real-world research techniques. However, I am asking three things:

1. **DO NOT** copy and paste code directly from Stackoverflow, or any other internet resource.
This counts as cheating, see above section of the syllabus. Instead, use solutions found in the
Internet as reference implementations to study and help craft your own solution.
2. **DO** attempt to solve all problems by yourself before looking up external resources - this
exercise will engage your analytical mind and force you to understand the problem better.
Ultimately, the value you get from this course is up to you, but I'd like to see every student learn
every topic to the best of their ability.
3. **DO** completely understand any code you write. This means that if you are stuck and go to the
internet for help, you do not just transcribe code, you study and understand an external solution
to the extent that you can implement the same algorithm independently. Trust me, this approach
makes a huge difference in improving you as a software engineer. Also, if you ever have a
question on a grade for a project, I will ask you to explain your code to me. If you can't, I can't
trust that you actually solved the problem.

Again, it’s up to you to get all the value you can from this course. This material is extremely
valuable to software engineers in the field, and will serve you well if you give it all you've got.
